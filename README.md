# Bundle-Core
 <br>
 A libriary that contains tools that expand basegame Abstract classes.
 WIthin you will find hooks that unify the functionality of Potions, Cards, Relic and Blights. (These may be WIP at the time of reading).
 
 There are also tools used in the creation of Bundles, ones not intended for outside use are marked with an annotation "@Dont_Use_This_Externally"
 
 Further to this there are also unified tools for creating main menu and music replacements, the legacy implimentations are hardcoded.
 
 <br>
 
 Current design goals:
 <br>
 1) Impliment a hook creation tool to unify item hooks.
  <br>
 2) Add a potion abstract to allow custom bottle-fill potions.
  <br>
 3) Create CustomBlight.
  <br>
 4) Impliment the final version of AMMT for creating main menu themes.
  <br>
 5) Add a modular config page for Main menu themes.
